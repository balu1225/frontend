# Portfolio Website

This directory contains my implementation of the [roadmap.sh Portfolio Website project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/portfolio-website). The goal is to practice structuring a single-page portfolio with sections for an introduction, work showcase, skills, and contact information using only HTML and CSS.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the page. Modify `styles.css` or the HTML content to personalize the design and information.
